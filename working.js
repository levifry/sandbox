/*

Outputs:
  Type and valid range for output

Inputs:
  Types and valid ranges for all inputs

Valid Input Types:
  TBD

Invalid Input Types:
  type string
  type number
  type boolean
  type object
  type array
  type null
  type undefined
  type NaN

Example Inputs & Outputs:
  A list of example inputs and outputs

Constraints:
  Identify time constraints e.g. return functions within a specified time
  Identify space constraints e.g. memory space, hard drive space, bandwidth
  Identify functionality constraints e.g. run the function only once
  Identify physical constraints e.g. viewport constraints

Edge cases:
  Identify edge cases that need additional consideration in your algorithm

Justification:
  In one or two sentences, describe the purpose of calling this function

Explanation:
  Clearly state the relationship between the inputs and the outputs
  Use plain english to completely explain the system's effects and behavior

Visualization:
  Draw a plan for solving the problem such that another engineer could understand it

Pseudocode:
  Each line of pseudocode should be:
    Complete (not relying on other steps to make sense to the reader)
    Without ambiguity as to what each step means
    As high level as possible (use helper functions to elaborate on each step)
    Indented to show subordinate relationships with other steps
    Translatable to one line of real code

Verification:
  Using sample data, walk through your pseudocode verify the plan works as expected. (When using TDD, you should write a test at this point.)
